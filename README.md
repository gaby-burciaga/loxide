# Lox implementation

Yet another lox implementation written in Rust.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn how to create a language, and how it works, in order to contribute, in the Rust
compiler (rustc), with code. So this lox implementation is primarly inspirated in the rustc implementation
with small changes.
